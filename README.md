# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. Right now, it only
includes the solutions I'm writing for the 2020 problems, but I hope to eventually clean up my solutions to the 2019 problems and post them here too.

Each day has a `dayXX.py` file that will run the code necessary to solve both stars for that day. Each file includes a header with a few comments on the problem.

All solutions are written in Python 3.8 (although most of them should also run fine with Python 3.6). From the `2020` directory,
you should be able to run each solution like this:

    $ python day01.py
